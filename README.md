Purpose of the Project:

The project aims to streamline and efficiently manage a library's operations, including tracking books, borrowers, and library branches. It provides a structured way to handle data and ensures accuracy and integrity in record-keeping.

Use Cases:
Efficient Data Management:

Enables centralized storage of data for books, borrowers, branches, and publishers, making it easy to query and maintain.
Improved Relationships:

Ensures proper linkage between related data points using primary keys and foreign keys, allowing for logical data organization.
Data Integrity:

By enforcing constraints, the database prevents duplicate or invalid entries, ensuring clean and reliable data.
Operational Queries:

Supports querying data to answer questions like:
Which books are available in a specific branch?
How many copies of a book exist across branches?
What books are borrowed by a specific user?
Scalability and Flexibility:

The schema design allows easy updates or scaling, such as adding more branches or books in the future.
Why Itâ€™s Useful:
This project is an excellent example of how database systems can simplify real-world problems by organizing data, improving efficiency, and enabling actionable insights through querying. 
It demonstrates the practical application of database design principles to solve common business problems.
